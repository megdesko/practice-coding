practice-coding
===============

This is my place to put practice algorithms and is a work in progress.  I write code at work, but it's more functional and less theoretical.
To fill in some of the gaps in my CS background, I'm practicing writing algorithms.  Most of these are implemented in PHP because it's my most comfortable language.  

Topics:

_Arrays and Strings_

- [x] Moving average of array
- [x] is palindrome?
- [x] string compression
- [x] finding unique characters in a string
- [x] reverse a string without using string_reverse


_Recursion_
- [x] Factorial
- [ ] Fibonacci numbers
- [x] String permutations

_Sorting_
- [ ] Bubble sort
- [ ] Merge sort
- [x] Quicksort

_Trees_

_Search_
- [x] binary search

_Linked Lists_
- [x] implement
- [x] delete a node by key
- [x] delete duplicate nodes
- [x] find kth from end item
- [x] partition list (greater/less than certain data value)
- [x] read the list
